    <p>
        Spinach and chickpea stew is a nutritious, plant-based meal packed with health benefits. Spinach is rich in vitamins A, C, and K, as well as iron and calcium, promoting strong bones and a healthy immune system. 
        Chickpeas are a great source of plant protein and fiber, helping to support digestion and maintain energy levels. 
        The stew is also made with heart-healthy olive oil and antioxidant-rich spices like cumin and coriander. This dish is low in calories but full of nutrients, making it a wholesome choice for a balanced, satisfying meal.
